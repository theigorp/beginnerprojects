I need to upgrade this about user inputing price of their tiles and the surface one tile covers

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <ctype.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <time.h>

int main()
{
    int width,length,surface;
	  float tileSurface = 0.3;
	  float tileCost = 5;
	  float tiles,total;

	  printf("Please enter width and length of the floor in meters \n(press enter after entering a value):\n");
	  scanf(" %d%d", &width, &length);

	  surface = width * length;
	  tiles = surface / tileSurface;
	  total = tileCost * tiles;

	  printf("It would take you %.1f tiles and it would cost you %.2f $\n", tiles, total);

    return 0;
}
